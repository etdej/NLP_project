The different folders are :
- data where datasets are stored
- data_processing : includes data_loader
- models : one file per model
- experiments : one file per experiment (different hyper-parameter for a model)

Call the experiments using the base directory as working directory
For instance :
    ’python -m experiments.exp0’
